## Problem Statement
Many small agencies and service businesses rely on:
- Spreadsheets
- Messaging apps (WhatsApp, Email)
- Multiple disconnected tools

This often leads to:
- Missed follow-ups

- Revenue tracking issues  

This CRM dashboard UI solves these problems by providing a clear, visual, and efficient workflow.

## Workflow Logic

1. A lead enters the system.
2. The lead moves through different pipeline stages.
3. Once converted, the lead becomes a client.
4. All client interactions are stored in the profile.
5. Tasks and follow-ups ensure no opportunity is missed.

This structure mirrors real-world agency sales processes.
